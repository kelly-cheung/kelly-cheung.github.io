# Hi! I'm Kelly Cheung
As a transitioning IT professional, I am driven by a passion for software development and database management, seeking new opportunities for growth in the tech industry.

My journey into IT was inspired by my years as a teacher in Hong Kong, where I developed a deep appreciation for productivity apps and their ability to streamline tasks and enhance efficiency. As a frequent user, I've come to appreciate the impact a simple, intuitive interface can have on enhancing peopleâ€™s lives. This experience ignited my desire to explore the potential of building my own productivity app, combining functionality with creativity to make a meaningful difference.

I am a continuous learner, excited to expand my skill set across various IT areas. I look forward to connecting with others who share similar or diverse interests, learning from each other's experiences, and growing together.
